# factored-attention

This repository contains code for reproducing results in our paper [Single Layers of Attention Suffice to Predict Protein Contacts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423882v2). This code is built entirely on  [Mogwai](https://github.com/nickbhat/mogwai), a small library for MRF models of protein families.  If you wish to use our Potts or attention implementations for your own exploration, it is easier to use Mogwai directly. If you have questions, feel free to contact us or open an issue!

## Installing

After cloning, please install mogwai and necessary dependencies with
```bash
$ make build
```

## Updating Mogwai Submodule

Anytime you pull, please be sure to update the Mogwai submodule as well
```bash
$ git pull
$ make
```


## Running a training run

Once you have set up your environment, run:

```bash
python train.py --model=factored_attention --attention_head_size=32 --batch_size=128 --l2_coeff=0.001 --learning_rate=0.005 --max_steps=5000 --num_attention_heads=256 --optimizer=adam --pdb=3er7_1_A
```
